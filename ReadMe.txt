This project is a chance for you to have some fun playing around with the Unity Editor and practice getting what you build in Unity onto your smartphone.

The goal is to customize the Udacity Carnival project, which will be something cool that you can show off to your friends and family! The Udacity Carnival consists of 3 Mini-Games: Plinko, Wheel of Fortune, and Coin Toss. With each game, you earn points. When you earn 2000 points, you will receive a virtual classic Carnival prize
